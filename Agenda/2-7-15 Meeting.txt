(1-17-16 Meeting): Specific bugs with draggableRects (condition being child, start being child, condition in conditional), sizing errors with assignment block, deleting active child causes errors in some parents (like switch)
(1-24-16 Meeting): Fix draggableRect spawn, overlapping landing area, angle brackets don't show up (encoding), compiling bug
(1-31-16 Meeting): Maximizing screen makes internal frames and shadows not line up, open file dialogue shows up twice, opening menu makes draggable rects show above both the menu and the internal frame
Note: decide whether to make condition part of conditional, make text block fatter
John - Make case block which is assigned to switch
Kyle - Continue: Fix maximizing screen makes internal frames and shadows not line up, make frames not visible when "rightMenuClick"
Yangqi - Continue working, fix second dialogue with loading file glitch, and add compile code for John's new conbined condition/conditional block
